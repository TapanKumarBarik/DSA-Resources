/*
 * Problem Description
 * You are given an array A consisting of heights of Christmas trees and an
 * array B of the same size consisting of the cost of each of the trees (Bi is
 * the cost of tree Ai, where 1 ≤ i ≤ size(A)), and you are supposed to choose 3
 * trees (let's say, indices p, q, and r), such that Ap < Aq < Ar, where p < q <
 * r.
 * The cost of these trees is Bp + Bq + Br.
 * 
 * You are to choose 3 trees such that their total cost is minimum. Return that
 * cost.
 * 
 * If it is not possible to choose 3 such trees return -1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Problem Constraints
 * 1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 109
 * 3 <= size(A) = size(B) <= 3000
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input Format
 * First argument is an integer array A.
 * Second argument is an integer array B.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Output Format
 * Return an integer denoting the minimum cost of choosing 3 trees whose heights
 * are strictly in increasing order, if not possible, -1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example Input
 * Input 1:
 * 
 * A = [1, 3, 5]
 * B = [1, 2, 3]
 * Input 2:
 * 
 * A = [1, 6, 4, 2, 6, 9]
 * B = [2, 5, 7, 3, 2, 7]
 * 
 * 
 * Example Output
 * Output 1:
 * 
 * 6
 * Output 2:
 * 
 * 7  
 * 
 * 
 * Example Explanation
 * Explanation 1:
 * 
 * We can choose the trees with indices 1, 2 and 3, and the cost is 1 + 2 + 3 =
 * 6.
 * Explanation 2:
 * 
 * We can choose the trees with indices 1, 4 and 5, and the cost is 2 + 3 + 2 =
 * 7.
 * This is the minimum cost that we can get.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Expected Output
 * Provide sample input and click run to see the correct output for the provided
 * input. Use this to improve your problem understanding and test edge cases
