What is the time complexity for inserting/deleting at the beginning of the array?

It consumes **O(n)** time to find the element you want to delete/insert .
As we cannot insert/delete element from an Array.
As in order to delete/insert it, you must shift all elements to the right of it one space to the left. This is also O(n) so the total complexity is linear.
